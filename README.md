navigation and obstacle avoidance: This consists of a Finite State Machine developed for the iRobot Create Series. 
                                   It also consists of an obstacle avoidance algorithm to help navigate the robot away
                                   from walls using its wall sensors and bump sensors. Other sensors exist but have
                                   not been implemented in this specific algorithm.
