CyberPhysicalSystemsAlgorithms
==============================

Embedded systems algorithms for robot control.

This repo consists of code developed for the online class EECS149.1x Cyber Physical Systems by UC Berkely's edX platform, BerkeleyX. 

This was a first attempt at an EECS course for me and a dive into embedded systems due to my interest in control systems from a aerospace perspective.

Navigation and obstacle avoidance
This consists of a Finite State Machine developed for the iRobot Create Series. 
It also consists of an obstacle avoidance algorithm to help navigate the robot away from walls using its wall sensors and bump sensors. Other sensors exist but have not been implemented in this specific algorithm.

If any  bugs exist please don't hesitate to contact me via Github.
